# TinyOC
A little emulator for OpenComputers, for Love2D.

## Scope
It does not simulate hardware limitations of OpenComputers, but tries to simply get most simple Operating Systems running (OpenOS, FrostOS, etc).

## Usage
Simply run TinyOC with Love2D, and pass in "--load FOLDERNAME" to load that folder as a drive on the virtual system (this clones the folder into a virtual drive, changes done on the computer will not be applied to the actual folder!)
